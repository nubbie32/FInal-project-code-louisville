This is my first project about a pet shop. Here is my web accessability score as well. It ranges from an introduction to the pet shop where they are located and what products they can offer you. I designed mobile first with mainly flexbox design. I then used grid for some of my larger media query. I used JavaScript with a hamburger menu and to change text on three H1 to help guide the user through the page. I have additionally added my  lighthouse score.
